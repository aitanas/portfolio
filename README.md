## Description

This is a simple website serving as my Epicodus portfolio landing page. In it, I have included links to some of my GitHub repositories thus far, a bit of background about myself, skills, and other interests.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

This portfolio may be viewed at the corresponding [**GitHub Pages site**](https://aitanas.github.io/portfolio/index.html). 

Alternatively, you may clone this project to your local machine by using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/aitanas/portfolio
```
Directions after cloning are as follows:
1. Open the **portfolio** directory.
2. Open the file named **index.html** with an internet browser (i.e. Google Chrome) of your choice.
3. Enjoy!

## Known Bugs

* The cards for Skills and Tables are not centered on the page, which I have been trying to find a solution for. Hopefully in the future!
