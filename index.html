    <p><span class="firstline">Hey! My name is Aitana. Welcome to my Epicodus programming portfolio.</span></p>
    <p>As a teenager, I learned to code HTML and CSS for the fun of making my own websites and blogs. I loved the creativity and problem-solving behind it, and was thrilled at the idea of making something of my own on the web.</p>
    <p>After high school, I got a Bachelor of Science in Biology at the <strong>University of Portland</strong> where I worked on research about the behavior of a small, six-rayed sea star called <em>Leptasterias spp</em>. During this time, I utilized my love for programming in several classes, including a Computational Biology course where I used Python to analyze genetic data. I was initially planning on continuing my academic career and applying for graduate school, but realized with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that I really valued spending time at home with my partner and our dog. I felt academia was not right for me and desired a steady, remote job that I was passionate about. After speaking to developer friends and Epicodus alumni, I decided to take the plunge and enroll in Epicodus's full-time bootcamp.</p>

    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to participate in dog sports with my two hounds, hike with friends, explore tidepools on the coast, and read (primarily fantasy and sci-fi). I dabble in dog photography and graphic design and am particularly involved with my dogs' breed club, the International Society of Silken Windhounds.</p>
