    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Aitana and I am taking a programming bootcamp at Epicodus.</p>
    <p>As a teenager, I learned to code HTML and CSS for the fun of making my own websites and blogs. I loved the creativity and problem-solving behind it, and was thrilled at the idea of making something of my own on the web.</p>
    <p>After high school, I got a Bachelor of Science in Biology at the University of Portland where I worked on research about the behavior of the small, six-rayed sea star <em>Leptasterias spp</em>. During this time, I utilized my love for programming in several classes, including a Computational Biology course where I used Python to analyze genetic data. I was initially planning on continuing my academic career and applying for graduate school, but realized with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that I really valued spending time at home with my partner and our dog. I felt academia was not right for me and desired a steady job that I enjoyed and could work remotely for. After speaking to developer friends and Epicodus alumni, I decided to take the plunge and enroll in Epicodus's full-time bootcamp.</p>

    <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
    <img src="img/argus-and-me.jpeg" alt="A photo of me and my dog Argus on a river beach after a hike." class="img-thumbnail">
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to participate in dog sports with my two hounds, hike with friends, explore tidepools on the coast, and read (primarily fantasy and sci-fi). I dabble in dog photography and graphic design and am particularly involved with my dogs' breed club, the International Society of Silken Windhounds.</p>
