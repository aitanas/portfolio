    <h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to participate in dog sports with my two hounds, hike with friends, explore tidepools on the coast, and read (primarily fantasy and sci-fi). I dabble in dog photography and graphic design and am particularly involved with my dogs' breed club, the International Society of Silken Windhounds.</p>
